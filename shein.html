        Founded by Amancio Ortega in 1975, Zara is a flagship clothing chain store that is part of Inditex group, the
        world's largest apparel retailer. Amancio Ortega opened the first Zara store in 1975 in central A Coru√±a,
        Galicia, Spain where the company is still based. Ortega initially named the store Zorba after the classic film
        Zorba the Greek, but after learning there was a bar with the same name two blocks away, the letters were
        remolded for the sign to say "Zara". It is believed the extra "a" came from an additional set of letters that
        had been made for the company.[8][9] The first store featured low-priced lookalike products of popular,
        higher-end clothing fashions. Ortega opened additional stores throughout Spain. During the 1980s, Ortega changed
        the design, manufacturing, and distribution process to reduce lead times and react to new trends in a quicker
        way, which he called "instant fashions". The improvements included the use of information technology and groups
        of designers instead of individuals.
